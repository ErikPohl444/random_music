# random_music

Problem to solve: I have a collection of Youtube bookmarks not in a playlist on any application.  I want to be surprised by a randomized music selection, selected from my bookmarks.

## Future plans

- [ ] Move future plans to issues
- [ ] Lint and refactor code
- [ ] Complete empty functionality and expand
 
## Important disclaimer

THIS CODE IS TERRIBLE.  I wrote it a long time ago and just now got around to adding it to a repo.  It was throwaway, and I'm now setting a goal to make it not throwaway.


## Getting Started

Download files.  Read the code and figure out how to hook it to an input file.  Execute it at your own peril ;)

## Prerequisites

I'll provide prereqs here.

## Installing

I will provide installation steps here.

## Running the tests

I will explain how to test the system here using the automated tests.

## Contributing

For now, I'd be excited to receive pull requests.  I don't have rules for contributing right now.
