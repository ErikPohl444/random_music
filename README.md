# random_music

Problem to solve: I have a collection of YouTube bookmarks not in a playlist on any application.  I want to be surprised by a randomized music selection, selected from my bookmarks.

**Note**: In this repo, I tested both pre-commit for git and GitHub actions using Yaml and confirmed both executed flake8 for linting.  I like both, but Actions is more foolproof.
## Future plans

## Important disclaimer

THIS CODE IS TERRIBLE.  
I wrote it a long time ago and just now got around to adding it to a repo.  It was throwaway, and I'm now setting a goal to make it not throwaway.

** Look at the start of process here **
What I do at work is a lot more complex, but I was very quickly able to assemble:
* a primitive CI/CD process with 
    * Git Hooks instantiated through pre-commit
    * GitHub Actions
* Issue templates for 
    * Bugs
    * Features
    * Information requests

I'll continue work on the process here, even if the code languishes a bit.

## Getting Started

Download files.  Read the code and figure out how to hook it to an input file.  Execute it at your own peril ;)

## Prerequisites

I'll provide pre-reqs here.

## Installing

I will provide installation steps here.

## Running the tests

I will explain how to test the system here using the automated tests.

## Contributing

For now, I'd be excited to receive pull requests.  I don't have rules for contributing right now.
